My name is Jwan and I'm from Germany.
I've been coding as side job since almost 3 years and learned in this journey a lot of things on my own. My first programming language was ***PHP***

It wasn't a good choice to learn PHP as first language, but it helped me to understand the OOP and Procedural paradigms.


## ***Some statistics about me***

It seems, that I'm in love with typescript :). 
This only from my public repos, but I usually code in Java and python.

## My favorite Stack 
#### ***MENT*** : MongoDB Express Node.js Typescript 
I try to keep it simple as possible to avoid scaling issues.


## What I'm I doing right now?
I'm still in the High school. Currently, I'm learning *C* to have better understanding of the low-level world 

## Any advice?
Even tho I count as joiner developer, but my advice is for godâ€™s sake use JWT and Implement it rightly. 
Here is my favorite JWT lib for Nodejs https://github.com/nearform/fast-jwt
